		<p>The light from my cell killed my eyes. This early in the morning what could be so goddamned important?</p><p>As I read the emergency alert with one eye I rubbed the sleep out of the other.</p><p>Then I sat up and read it again with both.</p><p>And again.</p><p>This has got to be some kind of joke.</p><p>I rolled over and threw my legs off the side of the bed, working them into my slippers.</p><p>I stretched and stood up, weakness wobbling my gait as I took a few steps towards the windows. I felt my heavy drapes resist parting, almost as if they knew what would happen.</p><p>As I peeked out down the street, I didn&#39;t see anything unusual at first, then I remembered, the sky.</p><p>I turned my gaze upwards to the sickly orange glow of the cities light pollution splayed across the clouds, and that&#39;s where I saw them. Small, black, jagged, like pieces of shattered onyx flocking through the sky, no wings, no sounds, countless shards of ebony wheeling and flitting to and fro in a chaotic scramble.</p><p>And then I stopped breathing. My hands let go of the drapes, my legs fell out from under me. Layed down on my carpet, I couldn&#39;t move, couldn&#39;t breathe.. Oh God, why did I look?</p>

		<p>Millie has fallen into a routine.</p><p>She wakes up at 6:30am, and goes fishing.</p><p>After setting her catches on her cooking rock, she turns the lamps to high and feeds the rest of the animals under her care.</p><p>She knows it&#39;s been 4 days since the first alert. She has no idea when the generators will run out of fuel.</p><p>The lizards need warmth and insects, the fish need their bubblers, filters, and fishfood, the fridges, lights, air conditioners, and the phone need power..</p><p>Millie knows her situation is unique. Most people caught away from home are probably in nice grocery stores or with strangers, not alone in a zoo, but she&#39;s just thankful the reptile house and the aquarium are in the same windowless building. She knows all the equipment and animals make noise, and the building is definitely putting out too much heat, but she doesn&#39;t know where any of the controls are, or how to work them. They might as well be on Mars.</p><p>She&#39;s thankful, she&#39;s got food, water, entertainment, and things to keep her busy.</p><p>It&#39;s the damn noise that bothers her.</p><p>All hours of the day and night. Chittering, skittering scratches on the walls and roof, at the heavy wooden doors.</p><p>She wonders how long until they break through..</p>

		<p>Millie jolted awake, panicked. The dream again, the same faceless, formless void calling to her, demanding she listen, obey.. But she could never hear what they want, never understand what they command..</p><p>And then she heard it. The silence. The lights were off. The air was stifling and humid..</p><p>The generators had finally died.</p><p>And all was silent. No more scratching, no more rustling. Dead silence.<br/>She checked her phone. She&#39;d plugged it up to charge before going to bed, so it was nearly at full charge, but no more updates, just the same repeated warning over and over again, every hour on the hour like clockwork.</p><pre><code>This is a state of Emergency.<br/>Remain in your shelters.<br/>Do not look outside.<br/>Do not look at the sky.<br/>Do not make noise.<br/>Do not make heat.<br/>To personnel with ∆6 clearance: Blue 12 procedures are in effect.<br/></code></pre><p>It&#39;s not like she had a choice before, but now she was in full compliance. It wasn&#39;t going to be long before the fish exhausted their oxygen and their water grew stagnant, after that the reptiles would starve as the supplies of freeze dried crickets and mice went bad.. Then the air itself, she was sure, would become toxic.</p><p>It was time to look into finding another place.</p><p>She didn&#39;t remember the benches being so heavy when she barricaded the doors that first time. Maybe, after a week away from the gym she&#39;d just gotten flabby. Either way, time to take a peek outside, just to be sure whatever they were really gone. She&#39;d use her compact mirror, no way she&#39;s looking directly.</p><p>As the door creaked open she though she heard something, but looking back it looked like the Savannah Monitor had just crawled up on it&#39;s branch. No big deal. Fresh cold air wafted through the crack and she resisted putting her face to it.</p><p>She slowly moved the compact mirror into position. She couldn&#39;t see anything, just pitch blackness.. No.. Wait.. There are edges.. Intersections in the dark.. Like cracks in glass..</p><p>Millie wondered why she was holding her breath, and then she realized she wasn&#39;t. She simply couldn&#39;t breathe. She slid down against the door, her weight pushing it closed again, her arms deadweights, falling to her sides. Her head fell, her chin coming to rest on her chest, she could see her ankles and feet poking out of her capris.. They were so pale.. So pale..

		<p>Sharon had always been a survivor. First in the hell of her childhood, then in the streets, in the shelters, then the Marines, Kandahar..</p><p>She thought she&#39;d finally escaped the constant sense of desperation. Out of combat, off the streets, a good job, working from home, her own apartment, a car stashed away in case she needed to leave town.. The anonymity of a concrete jungle.</p><p>New York though.. New York had gone to hell in a handbasket damn quick. She liked to do her shopping early in the mornings. She was picking up Rice and beans when her phone chirped the first warning.</p><p>She gathered supplies and made her way deep into the back of the store, in the center of the building she&#39;d found what she knew she would, basement access. Sewer access, access to the maintenance stairways and exhaust tunnels leading to the subways. That&#39;s why she&#39;d chosen New York. Plenty of winding tunnels and hidden abandoned areas to get lost in quick. Plenty of places to flee to.</p><p>She&#39;d gotten close enough to the active subway lines to know that they were no kind of shelter. All the street thugs and worst of the city had hit the subways as soon as things hit the fan.</p><p>Down there it was survival by knife and rule by might. So she went to her apartment and grabbed her bug out bag. MREs, cash, clothes, and weaponry. The laser rangefinder was the most useful tool though. She knew that if she was headed up near the surface that any opening to sky could mean her death. She&#39;d seen the dessicated corpses of people at doorways and not-quite-blocked windows too often in those first few days.</p><p>Now it was a matter of finding someplace, close to surface for airflow and signal, where she might be able to hole up, gather supplies, wait for the all clear. Survive.</p>

		<p>She had to be quick and quiet. Open, shove, click-click, yank, and close.</p><p>Open the hatch an inch or two.</p><p>Shove the hand with the range finder around the corner, pointing straight up.</p><p>Click it on.</p><p>Click it off.</p><p>Pull the hand back.</p><p>Close the hatch.</p><p>It was an exercise she&#39;d done a dozen times a day for the last week, and it always managed to set her on edge.</p><p>If the hatch opened to sky, she was pointing a laser straight up towards.. whatever the hell they were.. If it didn&#39;t, she risked being heard, seen, grabbed, by other, more desperate, less civilized denizens of the tunnels. But it was her only way to make it to the surface to check for updates.</p><p>Have to keep checking, have to wait it out. She had enough food, but she had to know when she could get to surface, when she could get to her car. It wasn&#39;t pretty, but it was tough, and it had a trunk with another set of bug-out bags. The tent might be useless, but the MREs wouldn&#39;t be.</p><p>She knew that whatever was left of New York after this wouldn&#39;t be safe. Too many good people died in the first day, never getting the message, and in the days after.. Too many bad people making it by victimizing others.. Savages.</p><p>Open..</p><p>Shove..</p><p>Click..</p><p>Click..</p><p>Yank..</p><p>Close.</p><p>Freezing in place, listening, holding her breath.. No sounds, no scurrying or shouting.. Good. Bringing the rangefinder close to her face to read the barely luminous display, she found it said 3 .1 meters.</p><p>Good, that&#39;s just the roof of another tunnel.</p><p>A sudden sound sent her heart tearing in two, into her throat and dropping through her stomach like a lead weight.</p><p><strong><em>Knock Knock</em></strong></p><p>It was sudden, terrifying, and hilarious. In a life or death situation, fearing rapists, murderers, possibly even cannibals, someone had seen her take the range and then politely knocked on the hatch above her like they were delivering a pizza.</p><p>If she wasn&#39;t on the edge of blacking out from the adrenaline she might have been in tears laughing at the absurdity of the situation.</p><p>But, should she answer? Or run? Find some other path upwards?</p>

		<p>Sharon took hold of the handle to the hatch firmly in her right hand, her left, her dominant hand, tightly gripping the .45 she&#39;d gotten from her first bug out bag, she readied herself to spring the hatch open and dive into the tunnel above, ready to roll, take aim, and fire if she had to.</p><p>With a silent count to three, she turned the handle and launched her entire body weight against the hatch and to the right, onto the ground, she heard a startled gasp and as she rolled into a crouching firing position, both hands on her weapon, her eyes down the barrel, lining up the iron sights.. On a little girl. No more than 10. Dirty, starving. In what once must have been a frilly yellow nightgown. She clutched a dead flashlight in her hands, tears in her eyes as she gasped and shook with fear.</p><p>As quickly as she&#39;d snapped on target she disengaged, putting the weapon on safe and holstering it as she stood, putting her hands up.<br/>&quot;I&#39;m not going to hurt you honey, I thought you might&#39;ve been..&quot;</p><p>And then with a flash of white light and sudden pain on the back of the head, her world went dark.</p></div>

		<div class="md"><p><strong>The Story of Emil &amp; Sarya</strong></p><p>Emil watched the woman like a hawk. She&#39;d come up from below like a demon, pointed a gun at his Sarya, and he&#39;d bashed her across the back of the head with his bat like he had all the other predators who&#39;d been hunting them.</p><p>But this woman was different. For one, well, she was a woman. All the rest of them had been men.</p><p>She was armed, but she didn&#39;t fire. Not that he could&#39;ve taken the chance, others had played at being peaceful too. Sarya was too important to take such risks. But now that he had her, what was he to do with her? With the men it was simple enough, stuff them in the hole they&#39;d come from, the next predator to come that way would get the warning, but a woman? She&#39;d be taken and raped, unconscious or dead. And Allah would never forgive such mercilessness on his part.</p><p>No, for better or worse, she was his prisoner. Her bag had been a treasure trove. Sarya had her first real meal in weeks, and the antibiotics and other medicines would surely come in handy if things went for much longer.</p><p>Sarya slept on top of the refrigerator. This stinking basement had been his first and only refuge. Thankfully it was under a block of well-off apartments, all with blinds. Most of them were unoccupied, summer homes of rich out of towners. and it seemed with each passing day another one of the occupied apartments went quiet. He imagined them opening their drapes and welcoming the scourge Allah had sent upon the world rather than slowly starving.</p><p>As he contemplated his position, he felt a familiar buzzing in his pocket. His phone was having another damn alert. Hour by hour, always the same now. He pulled it out to check anyway, saw it was the.. No! It&#39;s changed! New information thank goodness!</p><pre><code>Satellite mapping of the phenomenon has revealed that there are gaps and openings periodically in it&#39;s coverage of the Earth.<br/>The next projected opening in the phenomenon is expected to be in the major New York Metropolitan area between 0920 and 1000 hours.<br/>Due to the phenomenon operating at various altitudes, viewing of the sky is still strongly warned against.<br/>This is expected to be the only opening in the phenomenon for some time, as such, it is recommended you do not try and evacuate.<br/>Make a very short scouting trip for necessary supplies or superior shelter.<br/>Do not look at the sky.<br/>Do not make noise.<br/>Generate as little heat as possible.<br/>Move as slowly as possible to avoid accidental noise.<br/>To personnel with ∆6 clearance: Blue 12 procedures are no longer in effect, Red 4 procedures now supersede all previous orders.<br/></code></pre><p>Suddenly Emil could make out explosions. Distant, but distinct. </p><p>Someone, somewhere, was destroying something. He&#39;d been in Manhattan during 9/11, had heard those sounds before. Somewhere, a building was coming down.</p><p>He looked up at his daughter, still sleeping, and more earnestly than ever before, Emil prayed.</p>

			<div class="md"><p>Sharon was wandering in the dark. Echoes of images and horrors from the past emerging and then disappearing again along the edges of her consciousness.</p><p>Her fathers fat fingers and leering smile.</p><p>The moonlight glinting off the knife that first time she was stabbed in the alleyway she called home when she was 14.</p><p>The feel of terror, humilation, and pain as the gang from the group home &quot;claimed&quot; her when she was 17..</p><p>The flash from a mortar explosion in that god-forsaken desert when she was 22..</p><p>But somewhere.. elsewhere, distant.. Like drums, or a heartbeat... </p><p>An echo.. Thoughts.. Not her own.. The same voice that had been trying to get in for weeks, ever since.. No. That was just coincidence.. <em>Obey..</em> Resist! <em>Surrender..</em> Fight! <em>Despair..</em> Hope!</p><p>With a gasp she awoke. The light stabbed at her eyes. The pain in her head was unbearable. She looked around, squinting. She was in some kind of basement. She saw stacks of old furniture, dusty, disused. A workbench, a fridge. Light came from a single yellowed bulb hanging on a chain.</p><p>She was on a mattress, single, no sheets. the frame came up the side like a hospital bed.</p><p>Her wrists were bound behind her. by the feel of it, her own handcuffs, looped through a hole in the frame.</p><p>She tasted.. Orange Juice? Somebody had been giving her fluids bit by bit while she was unconscious. She was still clothed. a good sign. perhaps they hadn&#39;t searched her as thoroughly as they should have. She&#39;d have to see if she got the chance.</p><p>Suddenly she heard a door somewhere behind her open..</p><p>~</p><p>Emil had done his job, done as he was told. He&#39;d activated the package as the Alert had told him too, immediately after the gap in the phenomenon closed, he threw the switch. He heard the explosions, distant, a series.. And then a splash. Dockside perhaps? Or a bridge? He didn&#39;t know. Wasn&#39;t his place.</p><p>Blue 12 is hold but prepare all packages. Detonators, transmitters, balloons with sensor packages on rooftops. Those he&#39;d had to abandon, since he couldn&#39;t go outside. Red 4, detonate red Package 4, all other orders superseded.</p><p><em>All other orders superseded.</em> He wondered if that meant his Blue 12 was the same as others.. Were there others? He survived by chance. Could others have had other orders? He hadn&#39;t seen other messages in the alerts, but then, he was only a ∆6, no specialized comms, not even a government phone..</p><p>But that was alright. Now he just had one priority, no means to follow any other orders. Just one thing to be concerned with: Sarya.</p><p>Well, Sarya, and his prisoner.</p><p>As he opened the door to the basement, he saw a bit of small movement from the mattress. Good, movement meant she was alive. </p><p>After being out for two days, he&#39;d begun to worry the damage he&#39;d done was permanent.</p><p>He saw a small glimmer from under the pile of furniture in the far corner.. &quot;Good girl Sarya, stay hidden where I put you..&quot;</p><p>Leaning up against the workbench, he looked at his prisoner. Blonde, fit, weathered, maybe 30, 33.. Now that she was awake, he could see, she had hard eyes.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m glad to see you awake. I&#39;m sorry for having to hurt you, I&#39;m glad it wasn&#39;t too badly. I know you holstered your weapon when you saw my little girl, but I had no guarantee that wasn&#39;t a trick on your part. Are you thirsty? Hungry? I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t have much, well, more now, with your pack. I hope you don&#39;t mind I fed my daughter one of your MREs.&quot;</p><p>Sharon glared, she couldn&#39;t decide whether or not to trust him. He seemed innocent, but there was something to him she couldn&#39;t place, something he reminded her of. And nothing in her experience could make that a good thing.</p>

They seem to react like a predator, hunting by sight, sound, movement, and heat..</p><p>They are patient, seeming to interlock and form cocoons over buildings and vehicles that emit signs of life, waiting for an entrance, waiting for a gap, waiting for a way in.</p><p>They do not conform to anything previously encountered, biological or technological. They do not stop when hit with any form of weaponry yet tried, including chemical, biological, laser, sonic, or fission and fusion nuclear weaponry.</p><p>In short, ladies and gentlemen, after an entire month attempting every method of communication and combat, we have learned exactly nothing of use.</p><p>We have utilized agents all over the globe to preserve and isolate pockets of survivors as best we can.
